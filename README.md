Thank you for participating in this project!

Quick Description:
This project is an improvement to the Low Level Game Dev channel in the Cmake YouTube development project.

Edits:
A file named lib has been added to store Lib files. Once you save the Cmakelists.txt file without adding or modifying anything, the changes will be applied and all files will be saved, including the .lib file you added.

A file called PreprocessorDefinitions.txt has been added to add or pass one or more macros to the compiler when it is run with the target_compile_definitions command.
